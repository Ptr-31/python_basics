# You are given a JSON file containing data about employees in a company. And another JSON file containign
# salaries for the different departments. Write a Python function that reads this file, parses the JSON data,
# modifies it by adding a new key-value pair to each employee dictionary, and stores another json file a list
# of dictionaries containing information about each employee with the added key-value pair.
